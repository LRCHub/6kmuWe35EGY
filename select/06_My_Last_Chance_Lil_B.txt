There's a lot of shit I'm still waiting for Still wondering Crying on
This notepad Still waiting on healthcare,
Praying on welfare Gotta take my my hand up,
Gotta move my mind in Spend a lot of time there,
Getting on my grind there Throwing gang signs then,
Got a peace of mind there But I can't leave 'cause I know a piece of
Mine there People I grew up with don't wanna see me shining So I grew
Up with a lot of things? People do bad stuff,
Wanna stay away from it Got my mind right so I won't sleep in the
Casket Death around the corner and life is in the basket That's left
From a woman, cause The death of a woman means one less man So give
Respect to a woman I guess we just looking,
If you could see how I see it It's pain in your eyes, show em,
Bleed how I'm bleeding Just wanna talk, just one thing,
Won't forget what you did Just accept one thing:
I'm still waiting You know there's so much in my life I feel like I'm
Still waiting, you know what I mean You could pick and choose,
You could win or lose You could sink or swim,
You could stay or move Just had to amass,

I'm a faster blues I have the blues just hearing news Can't go a

Don't hold no grudge Niggas love to hate but don't show no love And
That's old man thinking If you closed-minded thugging,
That's no man's hustle No house, no home, no car, no bucket No old,
No young, but the ladies love him It's Lil B,
I still hustle from the bottom to the top Let the bitch niggas know
That I won't stop The hood feel like the invisible hood I'm the ghost
In the trees, I produce this wood I rap on the tracks that make the
Block Go crazy and the suburbs love me,
Word to cousin Right around the time I was hurting,
Struggling This dude had my back,
Gave me motivation I was asleep on the floor in the midst of the
Haters Taking trips with the money,
Paying for some changes Things started changing slowly Had the floor
Map, even helped the homies Got a new ride just to show the
Homie Bought my main bitch a flight, kissed her,
Says she's lonely I don't love her, groupie's a bitch,
That's word to Stunna Shoutout to Birdman,
That's word to Stunna I touch down in the hood,
I'm off the flight and blunted Lil Boss, I'm hundreds
