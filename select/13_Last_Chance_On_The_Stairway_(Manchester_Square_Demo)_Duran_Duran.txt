I don't remember quite how I met you, wasn't long ago
I just get a picture of sun, in your eyes, the waves in your hair
Maybe it's something said in a movie or you could've said last night
Just took me out on a limb and I don't really know what I'm doing here

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide
My beat's so in time, can you look at me?
I'm out of reach, I'll talk if it feels right
I've had my last chance on the stairway

Funny it's just like a scene out of Voltaire, twisting out of sight
'Cause when all the curtains are pulled back
We'll turn and see the circles we traced
Ain't no game when you're playing with fire
It doesn't seem right that we fight so the party runs on all night

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide
My beat's so in time, can you look at me?
I'm out of reach I'll talk if it feels right
So nervous to say, tell me can't you see?

If you want I'll fall out forever
I can't say no more, baby dance with me
And please don't say leave till later
I've had my last chance on the stairway

Wonder why, wonder why what makes me rise so high
Maybe it's something they put in your perfume or the look in your eyes
It could be the atmosphere sinking
Oh, I don't even know what you're thinking
Don't even know what you're drinking but it keeps this heaven alive

And sometimes I'm caught in a landslide
My beat's so in time, can you look at me?
I'm out of reach I'll talk if it feels right
So nervous to say, tell me can't you see?

And if you want I'll fall out forever
I can't say no more, baby dance with me
And please don't say leave till later
I've had my last chance on the stairway

Last chance on the stairway
Last chance on the stairway
Last chance on the stairway
