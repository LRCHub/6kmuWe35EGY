If you fall asleep with me
You can dream and drowse
The minutes turn to hours
We could climb a tree or two
And watch the sun go down
Upon our sleepy town
After all the time I spent with you
Summer went away
And we just weren't the same
It's just you and me alone
Not grown ups but not kids
You kissed me on the lips
